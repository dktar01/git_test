        <h1>This is the update version per TOP.</h1>
        <p>Hopefully underneath h1 there is this paragraph.</p>
        <h2>I like to add things in rows</h2>
        <p>Rows and rows and rows and rows and rows</p>
        <h3>Last line here, <em>Thanks</em></h3>

        <p> This is my test paragraph, there are many like it, but this one is mine</p>
        <p> The second paragraph just because. <strong>insert some bold text because TOP told me to.</strong> isn't really a paragraph because its just 2 sentences, but you get the idea.</p>


        <h1>This is a blog section</h1>
            <p>I am making this section because I wanted to express why I'm doing this.
                I don't want to keep working at the lumber mill and just get by, I want to learn
                this stuff so I can get a better job or career. 
                It just sounds like something I should do, plus, working from home sounds really nice.</p>
        

        <h1> This is a list of things I want to accomplish</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn HTML, CSS, Java, SQL</li>
                    <li>Create a decent Portfolio</li>
                    <li>Apply for a rewarding job/career</li>
                </ol>
